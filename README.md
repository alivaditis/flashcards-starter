# FlashCards

## Abstract

Flashcards is a game to test your knowledge of data types and methods that can be played in the browser!

## Technologies Used

Flashcards was built using javascript, utilizing the mocha testing framework and the chai assertion library.

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies using the command:

```bash
npm install
```

Running `node index.js` from the root of your project will start your game!
